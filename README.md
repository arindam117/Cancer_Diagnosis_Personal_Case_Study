# Cancer_Diagnosis_Personal_Case_Study
Case study on cancer diagnosis using Kaggle genetic dataset by classifying the genes, variation and text data into one of the 9 pre classes.

The objective is to find the probablity of a patient belonging to classes [1,2,3...9] given features Gene,Variation and text paraghaph. This problem is approached by choosing 
suitable KPI's and using different univariate analysis and understanding the feature importances followed the multi-variate Machine Learning approach. The Models used here are Naive Bayes, KNN & Logistic Regression. For each model multiple feature conversion techniques have been performed and Confusion Matrix, Precesion Matrix and Recall Matrixes are plotted.

Below are the screenshots from the case study
